# Assignment 4 â€” Logic, Loops, syntax, and datatypes

Complete the tasks below. Please turn in a single Jupyter notebook named `4_first_last.ipynb` (substitute your first and
last name). Please run Kernel > Restart & Run All on your notebook before turning in.

## A. Lists and loops

1. Create a list of 10 random integers in the range of -100 to 100.
2. Loop through that list using a for loop. Put the non-negative (positive or zero) integers into a new list. If
   negative integers are encountered, print a message saying that the value is negative and printing that value.

## B. Functions, lists, and loops

1. Write a function that does what you did in part A but with the following differences:
    - The input list can be any list of numbers.
    - The function should take as a parameter a threshold for being included in the new list (e.g., if you want
      non-negative integers, the threshold would be 0, and the function would check if values are >= to this value).
    - The printed message for failing to be included should also report the threshold parameter.
    - The new list should be returned by the function.
2. Execute the function on your list of 10 random integers.

## C. Dictionaries and list enumeration

1. Create a two-dimensional list with 3 'rows' and 4 'columns' and a mixture of strings and integers.
2. Loop through each element of the list and check if each element is a string or an integer. Save the strings as a
   dictionary with the index (row, column) as the key, and the string as the value. Save the integers as a dictionary
   with the index (row, column) as the key and the integer as the value.
3. Print out your dictionaries (no `print` command required).

## D. List comprehension and saving files

1. Create a list of 5 strings that are first and last names, e.g. `'Jon Doe'`.
2. Use a list comprehension (a single-line command) to get the first initial from each name and store each string (e.g.
   `'J'`) in a new list. Print this list (no `print` command required).
3. Repeat but store both the first and last initial (e.g. `'JD'`) in a new list. Print this list (no `print` command
   required).

## E. Reading files, sets, and saving files

1. Download this text file of past [World Series winners](../data/WorldSeriesWinners.txt).
2. Read in the lines of the file to a list, so that each line is an element of the list.
3. Create a new list with just those list elements that contain 'New York'; print that list, making sure there's not an
   extra newline character between each line. Print this list (no `print` command required).
4. Use the `set` class to convert the list of all World Series winners to a list of unique values. Print this list (no
   `print` command required).
5. Write the output to a new file.

## **Bonus Assignment:** Prime numbers

A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The assignment
is creating a list of prime number up to 100. Use the concepts of loops, conditionals, and operations learned in the
class.
