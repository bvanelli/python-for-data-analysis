## Lesson 1 â€” Python, IPython, Packages, and Jupyter Notebooks

The first lesson is to follow along with the [Jupyter notebooks](../lessons/lesson01.ipynb).

Get comfortable running Jupyter notebooks in your system and make sure that you understand the basics:

1) Download the repository according to the instructions
2) Activate your environment and launch the Jupyter notebook on the current folder. 
3) Running individual cells - do they all run? 
4) Adding new cells, and writing some code to it
5) Installing missing packages - try to install the package 
[`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/install.html) by yourself.
6) Navigating the notebook interface - can you use only your keyboard to get around?
