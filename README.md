# Python for Data Analysis

This teaching material has been developed for the course _CES Python Programming - Fundamentals (2,5 ECTS)_ for
the Hochschule Albstadt Sigmaringen.

Course in data science. Learn to analyze data of all types using the Python programming language. No programming
experience is necessary.

### Organization of classes

There are a total of 15 double classes. Each of the double classes will consist of:

- 45 minutes of topic introduction, with some live examples using Jupyter Notebooks.
- 45 minutes of exercises, where questions can be asked for each of the topics.
- One assignment for self-study.
- Additional reading material for the class content (from the textbook, online resources, etc.)
- For some classes one optional bonus assignment (if you want to learn things more in depth).

## Course Philosophy

1. You learn Python by doing, just like anything else. With a few exceptions, you're not going to break your computer by
   trying new commands. So try it and see what happens. Print output of commands. Print values of variables. Kick
   the thing until it works.
2. Resist the urge to get frustrated and blame the computer when your code doesn't run. Computers are deterministic
   machines; it's almost always your fault. But that's OK! Your computer will give you error messages that describe what
   went wrong. Read them and try to understand them.
3. When you don't know how to do something, google it. You'll be amazed by the solutions you'll find to do _thing x_ if
   you google "python thing x". StackOverflow will often have high-quality answers to your problem.
4. Resist the urge of using AI tools to do all the job or answer all your questions: doing so will often prevent you
   from learning from your mistakes. Remember that _"the master has failed more times than the beginner has tried"_.
   There will be a class where you will learn how to use AI tools to help you in your programming.
5. Learn keyboard shortcuts. Tab-complete in the shell and IPython/Jupyter!
6. Remember Zed's sage wisdom:
    * Practice every day.
    * Don't overdo it. Slow and steady wins the race.
    * It's alright to be totally lost at first.
    * When you get stuck, get more information.
    * Try to solve it yourself first.

## Assignments and Grading

### Weekly Assignments

Weekly take-home assignments will take the course schedule, reinforcing skills with exercises to analyze and visualize
scientific data. Assignments will be given out on Wednesdays and will be due the following Wednesday.

### Final Project

TODO

### Grading

The grade will be based on a final project that exercises the concepts learned in the class. The grading will be
done for both the project delivery (notebooks, code, and datasets) and a presentation. Both the project and
presentation will have the equal weight on the final grade.

## Schedule Overview

The course consists of 15 lessons. As a class, it is taught as one double-class per week for 15 weeks, but the
material can be covered at any pace. Each one of those classes will consist in a theory class, followed by a
practical class where questions will be answered.

The classes will cover basic concepts in Python and will be taught using Jupyter Notebooks.
