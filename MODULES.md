# CES Python Programming - Fundamentals (2,5 ECTS)

Course topics include:

- Fundamentals of Python and its data types
- Python programming logic, conditional, loops, functions, and Python objects
- Data analysis packages NumPy and Pandas
- Plotting packages like Matplotlib
- Basic Statistics
- Modules and classes
- Git and GitHub
- AI-assisted programming

## Organization of classes

There are a total of 15 double classes. Each of the double classes will consist of:

- 45 minutes topic introduction, with some live examples using Jupyter Notebooks.
- 45 minutes exercises, where questions can be asked for each individual topics.
- One assignment for self-study.
- Additional reading material for the class content (from the textbook, online resources, etc.)
- For some of the classes one optional bonus assignment (if you want to learn things more in depth).

## Grading

The grade will be based on a final project that exercises the concepts learned in the class. The grading will be
done for both the project delivery (notebooks, code, and datasets) as well as a presentation. Both the project and
presentation will have the equal weight on the final grade.

## Module description

### 1. Class overview: Python, IPython, Packages, and Jupyter Notebooks

- Introduction to the course, basic information, introduction to the "notebook-style" exercises and assignments
- Introduction to materials: online resources, textbooks, guidelines for usage of AI tools
- Quick run-through of what Python is with live-demo
- Launching a Jupyter Notebook
- Basics of Python syntax, variables, and data types
- All slides, exercises, and assignments will be on the Git repository
- **Assignment:** setting up a Github account and forking the class repository **(recommended)**. The content can also
  be downloaded directly without account creation. Afterward, you are invited to run through the exercises on your own.

### 2. Printing, Strings, Functions, Numbers

- Working and formatting strings
- String interpolation with format and fstrings
- Numbers and math
- Describing functions
- Getting help on libraries and functions
- Documenting functions with docstrings

### 3. Logic, Loops, Syntax, and data types

- Logic: boolean operations, equality testing
- Loops: for, while, break, continue, if else statements
- Range, increment, more complex loops
- More data types: List, tuples, dictionaries, sets, datetime, NoneTypes.

### 4. Taking Input, Reading and Writing Files, Functions

- Indexing with bracket/dot notation, loc, iloc
- transpose

### 7. Pandas Part II: Data cleaning and wrangling

- Basic data cleaning and preparation
- Data wrangling: join, combine reshape
- Pandas functions map, filtering, indexing, sorting
