    "> It's clearly both — **Linus Torvalds**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's lay some common ground: **language models are predictors for the next token**. They have a state, called the context window, and are able to remember certain context based on how big this state is allowed to be.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tokens are units that language models use to process text. The word 'strawberry' might be split into tokens like `['straw', 'berry']`, or 'understanding' into `['understand', 'ing']`. Common words are usually single tokens, while rare words get split into multiple pieces. This is why AI sometimes struggles with tasks like 'count the letters in strawberry' - it doesn't see individual letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the things that made language models so good at executing tasks are the attention models, that give different weights to different parts of the text, making predictions more accurate. This means these next token prediction can use information which is more relevant to the current prediction task, rather than considering the whole text. This is what allows modern LLMs to perform so well on tasks, even when the context window grows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing is that the models became extremely dense in information, requiring hundreds of hours of training in large data centers, which in turn increased resource usage. Models nowadays include more information than ever in their training data."

    "### What are the limitations?\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently, Deloitte has been called to refund the Australian government in $440,000 report ([text](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/oct/06/deloitte-to-pay-money-back-to-albanese-government-after-using-ai-in-440000-report) and [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oN0nViY4gn4) sources). The reason? The report has enhanced and had some entire parts written by AI models. Some patterns emerged from the investigation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Footnotes that were completely fabricated, using fictional books attributed to real people.\n",
    "- AI also referred to a key court case, but misquoted the judge.\n",
    "- It made up the name of another judge.\n",
    "- Multiple made up citations on the same report.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was very clear by the specialists that those \"fabricated entries\" were caused by AI hallucinations. Despite the controversy, Deloitte repeated the feat in Canada, being accused of [citing AI generated research in a million dollar report for a Canadian provincial government](https://theindependent.ca/news/lji/major-n-l-healthcare-report-contains-errors-likely-generated-by-a-i/). The papers simply did not exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with particular data, LLMs can also be [overwhelmed by too much information](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/context-window), and right now there is a sweet spot of how big this context window can be without impacting performance too much. This means that, as of now, AI systems are limited to their context size, and can start \"forgetting things\" when the data goes out of this context window.\n",
    "\n",
    "As said, the prediction of the text token is one characteristic that all LLMs, have in common, meaning that AI does not know anything: it will try to fix the next empty space with something that is _likely_ to be the correct answer. Here is a great example, where its internal knowledge conflicts with reality:\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/chatgpt-hallucination.png\" width=\"60%\"/>\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these premises, we can then compile a list of things that LLMs **are not good at** (by itself):\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is **not able to provide grounded information**: there is always the possibility the content being non-sense.\n",
    "- A language model deals with **language**, and it is not able to do arithmetic calculations. It has no concept of numbers either, and due to tokenization mostly no clear concept of letters (e.g., one famous example was the task _\"how many r's in the word 'strawberry'?\"_, where AI used to fail due to the nature of tokenization, that converts _strawberry_ into a single token).\n",
    "- Similar to the previous point, it is not able to decide **what code is correct, and which isn't**.\n",
    "- Since every output is probabilistic, LLMs **cannot provide consistent output**: consecutive queries, with the same context will yield different results.\n",
    "- LLMs **have trouble keeping up to date with information** that was not present in training data: non-public frameworks and libraries that are updated often suffer from outdated content generated by the models, due to knowledge cutoff.\n",
    "- Similar to the previous point, **languages with low training data cannot provide good output**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are also going to cover ways in which we can overcome some of those problems. For example, for the problem of _arithmetic calculations_, the LLM _can_ compute all mathematical expressions using a calculator."

    "### What is it good at?\n",
    "\n",
    "As many of you may have experienced: LLMs are great at a wide range of tasks surrounding software development. I'll just list a few:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Planning of implementation**: doing concepts on what the software should look like, interface design, generation of UML models.\n",
    "- **Generation of code boilerplate**: code that is necessary for an application to work but is very repetitive.\n",
    "- **Generation of common algorithms**: tasks like data analysis and API implementation, where examples are abundant, tend to offer good results. Often, the result will offer quality that you could expect from a more experienced developer, as long as the problem is well-defined with clear requirements.\n",
    "- **Code review and debugging**: it can accurately identify antipatterns in the code, as well as suggest improvements. It can also identify bugs early, and able to spot issues in the code based on the errors you received.\n",
    "- **Learning companion**: explains unfamiliar concepts, deep-dives into code bases to provide high-level summaries.\n",
    "- **Documentation and communication**: summarizes changes in a human-readable manner, generates/updates documentation for complex functions.\n",
    "- **Quality review**: able to ensure good quality by being critical of your work, and suggesting improvements."

    "\n",
    "This has many advantages over using the chat, but also has its limitations: you can only work with files that you specifically passed to the plugin, so you have to manually decide what needs to be changed and where. It is not able to plan and execute tasks by itself:\n",

    "## API Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "You can build and integrate your own solutions using an **API Key** that can directly call a provider endpoint and get responses for prompts. There are already thousands of integrations out there capable of doing just that, that implement all sorts of applications: Telegram bots, remote code assistants, email sorters, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal here is to allow you to **build your own products** with an interface that can be used programmatically. Frameworks like [langchain-ai/langchain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain) focus on providing the building blocks for creating your own agents for decision making, RAG, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "One other example is the `jupyter-ai` integration that connects to multiple providers and is able to generate responses directly on a Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the **API usage is subject to its own billing**: even if you don't have to pay for the free tier of an LLM, the API user pay per consumption, usually in batches of 1M tokens. For small projects, free tiers often suffice, but production applications need to budget for API costs."

    "There are many types of reasoning, but a general approach is to implement a _chain of thought. _Thinking_ or _Reasoning_ is the process of breaking down problems into smaller, achievable steps, enabling the model to tackle bigger and more complex problems. This is essentially how we humans tackle problems. Because the model can prompt itself multiple times for consistency, this increase in **allocated budget will be directly linked to model cost**. [According to NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/ai-reasoning/), reasoning queries may require **100 times more computing than traditional queries**.\n",
    "\n",
    "As examples, [Claude uses](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices) the keywords _\"think\" < \"think hard\" < \"think harder\" < \"ultrathink.\"_. [Gemini uses](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/thinking) a number range to enable progressive thinking for the models.

    "## Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key advantages of modern AI agents is their ability to use **tools** - external capabilities that extend beyond text generation. While LLMs by themselves can only generate text, tools allow them to interact with the real world: read files, execute code, search the web, run calculations, and much more.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How tools work\n",
    "\n",
    "When you ask an agent to \"read the file data.csv\", the LLM doesn't magically access your filesystem. Instead:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The agent recognizes it needs to read a file.\n",
    "2. It calls a **read file tool** with the path parameter.\n",
    "3. The tool executes and returns the file contents.\n",
    "4. The agent receives this information and continues its task.\n",
    "\n",
    "This solves many of the limitations we discussed earlier:\n",
    "- **Arithmetic calculations**: The agent can call a calculator tool.\n",
    "- **Current information**: The agent can search the web.\n",
    "- **Code correctness**: The agent can execute code and see if it works.\n",
    "- **File operations**: The agent can read, write, and modify files.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common tool categories\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some typical tools that agents have access to:\n",
    "\n",
    "**File operations:**\n",
    "- Read, write and edit files (source code, data files, documentation)\n",
    "- Search for files matching patterns (e.g., find all `.py` files)\n",
    "- Search within files (e.g., find where function `foo` is defined)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code execution:**\n",
    "- Run bash commands\n",
    "- Execute Python scripts\n",
    "- Run tests\n",
    "- Install packages\n",
    "- Start servers or applications\n",
    "\n",
    "**Information retrieval:**\n",
    "- Web search (Google, Bing, etc.)\n",
    "- Fetch content from URLs\n",
    "- Read API documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Development tools:**\n",
    "- Git operations (commit, push, create branches)\n",
    "- Create pull requests\n",
    "- Run linters and formatters\n",
    "\n",
    "### MCP Servers (Model Context Protocol)\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard developed [by Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol) that allows AI agents to securely connect to external data sources and tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key advantage of MCP is **standardization**: instead of each AI provider creating custom integrations, MCP provides a universal way for any AI agent to connect to any data source. This means you can use the same MCP server with Claude, ChatGPT, or any other compatible AI tool. Think of it as the USB-C port for AI Applications.\n",

    "An example for a useful MCP Server is [Context7](https://context7.com/), a tool that allows you to get up-to-date documentation for libraries, avoiding the issue with the training data being outdated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tools in practice for data science\n",
    "\n",
    "Without tools (chat only):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "You: \"Analyze the dataset in data/sales.csv\"\n",
    "AI: \"I cannot access files. Please copy the contents here.\"\n",
    "[You copy-paste 5000 rows...]\n",
    "AI: [Might hit context limits, cannot verify code works]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "With tools (agentic mode):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "You: \"Analyze the dataset in data/sales.csv\"\n",
    "AI: [Reads file using file tool]\n",
    "AI: [Examines structure, identifies columns]\n",
    "AI: [Writes analysis script]\n",
    "AI: [Executes script using code execution tool]\n",
    "AI: [Sees error, fixes it, re-runs]\n",
    "AI: \"Here's your analysis with visualizations in output/sales_analysis.png\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent can iterate, verify its work, and deliver working solutions because it has the tools to interact with your actual development environment.\n",

    "2. **Agent context files set boundaries** - Your CLAUDE.md or agents.md should specify what the agent should and shouldn't touch\n",

    "\n",
    "AI is a powerful tool, but with power comes responsibility. As data scientists and developers, we need to consider both the ethical implications and environmental impact of our AI usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, the [linked article from MIT Technology review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/05/20/1116327/ai-energy-usage-climate-footprint-big-tech/) shows that the surge in the demand for computing power makes data centers consume 4.4% of the electricity available in the US, with a carbon intensity almost 50% higher than the US average.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When NOT to use AI\n",
    "\n",
    "There are scenarios where AI assistance is inappropriate or even dangerous:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **When working with sensitive data**: Your data gets uploaded to external data providers, including your business logic. Never paste confidential data, personal information, or trade secrets into public AI services.\n",
    "- **Academic integrity:**: Using AI to complete assignments without understanding violates academic integrity. **Acceptable:** \"Explain how groupby works in pandas\". **Unacceptable:** \"Complete my assignment and write the report\".\n",
    "- **Critical decision-making:**: Don't rely solely on AI for decisions affecting people's lives, safety, or livelihoods. In data science: AI can help analyze data, but you must verify conclusions before acting on them\n",
    "- **High-stakes production code:** AI-generated code for security-critical systems needs extensive review. Never deploy AI-generated code to production without testing and human verification.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Always verify the output\n",
    "\n",
    "You are responsible for every line of code you use, whether you wrote it or AI did.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you cannot explain your code, then is not useful code. Try again.\n",
    "- Verify citations actually exist, preferably consulting them yourself.\n",
    "- Check for security vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, etc.).\n",
    "- Be skeptical of what it generates. LLMs are very good at generating text, that even non-sense might _look_ belieable.\n",
    "- Use AI-generated content as a starting point, not the final word.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Environmental impact\n",
    "\n",
    "AI has a significant environmental footprint that we should be mindful of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- According to research, AI queries use significantly more energy than traditional searches.\n",
    "- Training large models requires massive computational resources.\n",
    "- Reasoning/thinking modes can use 100x more compute than standard queries.\n",
    "- Data centers running AI contribute to CO2 emissions and water usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "So you should:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Think before you prompt**: Formulate clear, specific prompts to avoid multiple iterations. Sometimes, you don't even need to prompt. \n",
    "- **Use appropriate models**: Don't use heavyweight reasoning for simple questions.\n",
    "- **Prefer efficient modes**: Chat and IDE plugins are often more efficient than repeated web queries.\n",
    "- **Batch your questions**: Ask multiple related questions in one prompt instead of many small queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finding the balance\n",
    "\n",
    "AI is neither a magical solution nor something to be feared. It is a tool:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use AI to augment your capabilities**, not replace your thinking.\n",
    "- **Apply it to appropriate problems** where it can genuinely help.\n",
    "- **Verify outputs** and take responsibility for what you deploy.\n",
    "- **Consider the broader impacts** - ethical, environmental, social.\n",
    "- **Keep learning and adapting** as the technology evolves."
