    "> - **Raw data is immutable**: This informs the design of the default data/ directory subfolders in which data originates from `raw/` and `external/`, intermediate analytical outputs get serialized or cached in `interim/`, and final products end up in `processed/` (the number or names of these folders is less important than the flow of data between them). \n",
    "> - **Notebooks are for exploration and communication, source files are for repetition**: Refactor the good parts into source code.\n",
    "> - **Keep your modeling organized**: You should implement experiment documentation procedures that enable you to, at minimum, identify the provenance of the data and the version of the code that the experiment used, as well as the metrics used to measure performance.\n",
    "> - **Encourage adaptation from a consistent default**: A project's organizational needs may differ from the start and can change over time."
