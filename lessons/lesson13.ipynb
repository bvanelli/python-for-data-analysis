    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll only focus on the [SOLID principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID), then directly go into how to apply it into the Python language with examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "_SOLID_ is an acronym, and stands for:\n",
    "\n",
    "### S: Single-Responsibility Principle\n",
    "\n",
    "> A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoid creating structures that have too many responsibilities. A class represents one thing, a function does one thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: if you want to create a class called `User`, the property `has_permission` would be included, but you **wouldn't** create a method called `log_in_and_check_permissions`, since the method does more than one thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### O: Open-Closed Principle\n",
    "\n",
    "> Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once an object is created (e.g., a class), you should treat this as an unmodifiable object, and assume people already depend on its interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "The class can be extended, but current functionality remains the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** if you have a class `Rectangle` that takes `(x, y)` and returns the `area()`, it is correct to add an additional method called `perimeter()`, thus extending the class. You **cannot** rename `area()` to `ground()` or `section()`, since this method is considered unmodifiable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### L: Liskov Substitution Principle\n",
    "\n",
    "> Let q(x) be a property provable about objects of x of type T. Then q(y) should be provable for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T.\n",
    "\n",
    "This deals with inheritance, and essentially tells that classes and sub-classes are interchangeable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** if you have a class called `Vehicle`, with the method `start`, then you create a sub-class `Car` and `Bus`, both with defined `start` methods, this would follow the principle. If I create a class called `Bike`, this **breaks the principle** since you cannot start a bike. You could, however, create an `EBike` class, that is also startable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### I: Interface Segregation Principle\n",
    "\n",
    "> A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn’t use, or clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on methods they do not use.\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, interfaces represent ways to interact with a certain object, identifying which functions this interface offers you. The client should not be forced to implement an interface it does not use.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: in the previous example, we could get around the Liskov principle by implementing an empty `start` method for the `Bike`. Since we can consider the `Vehicle` as describing and interface (how to interact with _any_ vehicle), and we are _forced_ to implement something we do not use, this principle is broken.\n",
    "\n",
    "### D: Dependency Inversion Principle\n",
    "\n",
    "> Entities must depend on abstractions, not on concretions. It states that the high-level module must not depend on the low-level module, but they should depend on abstractions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a bit more conceptual and requires you think of the high-level abstractions first, then proceed into the implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This goes together with the interface principle, as it encourages of thinking of an interface first, then on the individual concrete components.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** If you implement a `USBDevice` (computer USB interface), this device will contain the `connect`, `send` and `receive` methods. This interface is entirely abstract, but you can create a _concrete_ implementation by extending this interface with for example a `Mouse` or `Keyboard`, that will extend the high-level model."

    "\n",
    "It defined some basic standards on how Python projects should look like, to keep codebases consistent across the board, with the goal of keeping projects readable (one of the biggest focuses of the Python programming language).

    "\n",
